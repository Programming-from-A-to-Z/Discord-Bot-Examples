# Discord Bot Examples

This repository provides examples and a step-by-step guide on how to create a simple Discord bot using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

## Steps to Create Your Bot!

### 1. Set Up Your Project

Create a new Node.js project and install necessary dependencies.

```sh
$ npm init
$ npm install discord.js
```

Add a property `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file in order to use ES6 module import syntax.

These examples use Node.js 22 or newer, which includes built-in support for loading `.env` files (no `dotenv` package needed).

### 2. Create a Discord Application

- Navigate to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new application.
- Optionally, set the application name, description, and avatar.
- Note down the "Application ID" (also known as "Client ID").

### 3. Create and Configure Your Bot

- In the Discord Developer Portal, select "Bot" from the left navigation.
- Set a name and icon for your bot.
- Note down the "Bot Token" (keep this secret).

### 4. Add Bot to a Server

- Go to your application page in the Discord developer portal.
- Navigate to "OAuth" -> "URL Generator".
- Check "application.commands" and "bot".
- Open the URL that populates at the bottom and authorize the bot to access your server.

### 5. Enable Developer Mode in Discord

- Enable "Developer Mode" under the "Advanced" settings tab on your Discord client.
- Right-click on the server icon, and select "Copy ID" to get the server ID.

### 6. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your client ID, server ID, and bot token:

```plaintext
CLIENTID=1234
SERVERID=1234
TOKEN=1234
```

These environment variables are used to keep sensitive data, like your bot token, out of your code. This is especially important if you're sharing your code with others or storing your code publicly on GitHub. (Notice how `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.)

### 7. Create the bot code!

Create `bot.js` (or `index.js`) and paste this code:

```javascript
import { Client, Events, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';

// Load environment variables from .env
process.loadEnvFile();

// Create a new client instance
const client = new Client({
  intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds],
});

// When the client is ready, run this code (only once)
client.once(Events.ClientReady, readyDiscord);

// Login to Discord with your client's token
client.login(process.env.TOKEN);

function readyDiscord() {
  console.log('💖');
}
```

Run to see if it works! (If you see the 💖 it's working!)

```sh
$ node bot.js
```

## 8. Create a Command

Each command should be handled in a separate JS file, there are many ways you can manage this, but I suggest putting them in a folder called commands:

```javascript
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';

// Command Builder export
export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('choochoo')
  .setDescription('Replies choo choo!');

// Execute function export
export async function execute(interaction) {
  await interaction.reply('Choo choo!');
}
```

## 9. Deploy the commands

Create `deploy-commands.js` and copy the [example code](/deploy-commands.js). Then run it!

```sh
node deploy-commands.js
```

You only have to do this once. If you change the command (altering descriptions, changing options, etc.), then you do need to re-run `deploy-commands.js`.

## 10. Add the code to handle the command

You also need to handle the command in bot.js, add the equivalent code:

```javascript
import * as choochoo from './commands/choochoo.js';

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, handleInteraction);

async function handleInteraction(interaction) {
  if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;
  if (interaction.commandName === 'choochoo') {
    await choochoo.execute(interaction);
  }
}
```

Then run the bot again!

```sh
node bot.js
```

## Recap of the code elements

- `commands/choochoo.js`: Defines a simple slash command.
- `bot.js`: Handles interactions with Discord and executes commands.
- `deploy-commands.js`: Script to register slash commands with Discord API.

## Additional Bot Features

The bot includes additional features requiring extra permissions and intents. To use these you'll have to make sure you select the permissions on the OAuth page as well as enable the "read message content" option in the Discord Developer Portal.

- `GuildMessages` - For receiving messages.
- `GuildMessageReactions` - For handling emoji reactions.
- `MessageContent` - Allows the bot to access message content for more interactive responses.

### Features

#### 1. Posting GIFs from GIPHY API

The `/gif` command fetches a GIF from the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) and embeds it in the chat. You can customize the search term with a `keywords` option. (This example previously used Tenor, but Google shut down the Tenor API in June 2026.) To get started, create a free API key on the [GIPHY Developer Dashboard](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/) and add it to `.env`:

```
GIPHYKEY=your_giphy_api_key
```

#### 2. Creating Random Walk Images with Canvas

The `/randomwalk` command generates an image with random movements using the [`@napi-rs/canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/canvas) library. It works like the HTML canvas API and installs prebuilt binaries, so there are no system libraries to set up.

```sh
$ npm install @napi-rs/canvas
```

```javascript
import { createCanvas } from '@napi-rs/canvas';
```

#### 3. Rock Paper Scissors Game

Use `/roshambo` to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. The bot responds with interactive buttons, allowing you to pick your choice while it randomly picks for itself.

#### 4. Message Listening and Reactions

The bot can listen for messages in a specified channel and respond to messages with text or reactions. For example, if a message contains digits, the bot reacts with a number emoji.

```javascript
client.on(Events.MessageCreate, (message) => {
  if (message.content.match(/\d+/)) {
    message.react('🔢');
  }
});
```

#### 5. Emoji Reaction Tracking

The bot tracks emoji reactions and updates a heart count when users react with ❤️. It also saves the count to a JSON file so it persists even if the bot restarts.

```javascript
client.on(Events.MessageReactionAdd, (reaction, user) => {
  if (reaction.emoji.name === '❤️') {
    heartCount++;
    fs.writeFileSync('data.json', JSON.stringify({ hearts: heartCount }));
  }
});
```

#### 6. Heartbeat Messages

The bot can send periodic updates in a specified channel, such as a heartbeat message showing the total ❤️ count. This is done with `setInterval` to create timed posts.

```javascript
function startHeartBeat() {
  setInterval(() => {
    danChannel.send(`❤️ I have ${heartCount} hearts ❤️`);
  }, 60 * 60 * 1000); // Posts every hour
}
```
